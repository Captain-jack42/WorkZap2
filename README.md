### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Captain-jack42/WorkZap.git
cd WorkZap
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create environment file**
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the required variables shown in the example below.

4. **Run in development**
```bash
npm run dev
# or
node app.js
```

5. **Open in browser**  
Visit `http://localhost:3000` or the port you configured.

---

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with these keys and appropriate values:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.mongodb.net/workzap
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=you@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

**Important**  
- **Do not commit** `.env` to version control.  
- Use a secrets manager or environment variables in production.

---

### Run Scripts
- **Install**: `npm install`  
- **Start development**: `npm run dev` (uses nodemon)  
- **Start production**: `node app.js`

Add linting and test scripts as the project grows.

```
- **app.js** is the application entry and Express setup.  
- **controllers** contains route handlers and business logic.  
- **models** contains Mongoose schemas.  
- **routes** maps endpoints to controllers.  
- **views** contains EJS templates and partials.  
- **public** holds static assets like CSS and client JS.  
- **utils** contains helper functions and middleware.  
- **config** stores configuration helpers.

---

### Deployment Notes
- Use a managed MongoDB service such as MongoDB Atlas for production.  
- Configure `connect-mongodb-session` as the session store and set `cookie.secure = true` when using HTTPS.  
- Use HTTPS and set secure cookie flags and proper CORS policies.  
- For horizontal scaling, use a Socket.io adapter (Redis) to share socket state across instances.  
- Add CI/CD to run linting and tests and to deploy to a host such as Heroku, Render, or a VPS.

---

### Security Best Practices
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt and never store plaintext passwords.  
- **Validate and sanitize** all user input on the server side.  
- **Rate limit** authentication endpoints to reduce brute force risk.  
- **Use HTTPS** in production and set secure cookie flags.  
- **Rotate secrets** and store them in environment variables or a secrets manager.  
- **Limit file upload types and sizes** if you add resume or avatar uploads.
